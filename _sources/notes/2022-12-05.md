# How does all of this work together?


## Contract Checkin



Create an issue on your grading contract using the following as a template, use the title, "Contract Checkin"

Edit so that it applies to you, including deleting any sections that do not apply to you.
```
I am (not) on track to complete my contract as agreed.


I plan to (catch up/ revise my contract / take an incomplete).

To revise my contract I will:
<!-- consultation is optional -->
- [ ] attend office hours to discuss options
- [ ] submit the revised contract as PR by the contract revision deadline of December 12.


To catch up, I will:
- [ ] request a review from @brownsarahm and @m-bowen in all of my open PRs by 7pm today
- [ ] attend office hour on (dates)
- [ ] complete (items) by 12/6 at 3pm
- [ ] complete (items) by 12/8 at 5pm
- [ ] complete (items) by 12/13 at 3pm
- [ ] complete (items) by 12/15 at 3pm
- [ ] complete (items) by 12/19 EOD

To complete work after accepting an Incomplete grade I will:
- [ ] complete all activities in my contract by (date)

I have the following questions about my grade/grading in this course:

- [ ] q1
- [ ] q2
```

Assign @brownsarahm on the issue so that I can get to it easily.

Please *also* copy & paste your questions here on Prismia so that I can answer common, general ones in class. I will answer personal ones on the issue

##  IDEA

If we hit a 75% response rate, then you will all get up to three "gifts" where instead of revising, I will give you an answer you need to acknowledge.  


## Review Questions


Why do we need to lock writing to a global variable when threading a program?

- [ ] otherwise all threads will overwrite incorrectly and only the slowest one will be saved
- [ ] otherwise their start/finish order can impact the calculation
- [ ] it is the only way for a variable to be shared across threads


Why do we use version control?

- [ ] to have a cloud backup of code
- [ ] it's a legacy tool for undoing changes before IDEs could do it
- [ ] to be able to separate different versions of code




Why floating point instead of fixed point for fractions ?

- [ ] floating point allows for faster calculations
- [ ] floating point allows more precise representation
- [ ] floating point allows for representation of a broader range of values




Label and put in order the following steps:

```

x. **step** binaries for compiled libraries is combined with the compiled program code
x. **step** code is translated from assembly to machine code
x. **step** code from includes is copied into the file
x. **step** code is translated from a high level language to assembly
```

## More Practice

```{important}
- If you're on track, you can skip the remaining ones
- if you are not on track: **the remaining three will count for two each, but will be more complex**
