# How do git references work?

```{important}

This picks up directly from the class 2 sessions ago

```

We will go back to the test repo and review waht we have there.
```
cd ../test/
ls
```


```
test.txt
```


```
cat test.txt
```

```
version 1
version 2
```


```
git status
```

```
On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   test.txt

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   test.txt

```

We have a few files and we have content staged and unstaged as changes to those files.


```
git log
```

```
fatal: your current branch 'main' does not have any commits yet
```

Notice, we have no commits yet even though we had written a commit.  This is because the main branch does not point to any commit.

```
fin .git/objects/ -type f
```

```
-bash: fin: command not found
```

To get a better look, we can list the objects.
```
find .git/objects/ -type f
```

```
.git/objects//0c/1e7391ca4e59584f8b773ecdbbb9467eba1547
.git/objects//d6/70460b4b4aece5915caf5c68d12f560a9fe3e4
.git/objects//d8/329fc1cc938780ffdd9f94e0d364e0ea74f579
.git/objects//e0/9139a38f4fd6d82715c32aab9adfed67a87ba5
.git/objects//83/baae61804e65cc73a7201a7252750c76066a30
```

We can see that indeed we have one object that is a commit

```
git cat-file -t e0913
```

```
commit
```

And we can look at its contents
```
git cat-file -p e0913
```

```
tree d8329fc1cc938780ffdd9f94e0d364e0ea74f579
author Sarah M Brown <brownsarahm@uri.edu> 1665005715 -0400
committer Sarah M Brown <brownsarahm@uri.edu> 1665005715 -0400

first commit
```


Let's add one more new file to review


```
echo "new file" > new.txt
```

first we hash the object. The `-w` option writes to the directory.

```
git hash-object -w new.txt
```

then we get the hash back
```
fa49b077972391ad58037050f2a75f74e3671e92
```

Then we stage it.
```
git update-index --add --cacheinfo 100644 \
> fa49b077972391ad58037050f2a75f74e3671e92 new.txt
```

and again we can look on the overall repo

```
git status
```

```
On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   new.txt
	new file:   test.txt

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   test.txt

```

and list out the `.git` objects
```
find .git/objects/ -type f
```

```
.git/objects//0c/1e7391ca4e59584f8b773ecdbbb9467eba1547
.git/objects//d6/70460b4b4aece5915caf5c68d12f560a9fe3e4
.git/objects//d8/329fc1cc938780ffdd9f94e0d364e0ea74f579
.git/objects//fa/49b077972391ad58037050f2a75f74e3671e92
.git/objects//e0/9139a38f4fd6d82715c32aab9adfed67a87ba5
.git/objects//83/baae61804e65cc73a7201a7252750c76066a30
```


```
git cat-file -p 0c1e
```

```
version 1
version 2
```

then we can stage the second version of our first file
```
git update-index --add --cacheinfo 100644 \
> 0c1e7391ca4e59584f8b773ecdbbb9467eba1547 test.txt
```


```
git status
```

```
On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   new.txt
	new file:   test.txt

```
and now we see that everything is staged.

Then we confirm what hash is our previous commit

```
git cat-file -t e0913
```

```
commit
```


```
git cat-file -p e0913
```

```
tree d8329fc1cc938780ffdd9f94e0d364e0ea74f579
author Sarah M Brown <brownsarahm@uri.edu> 1665005715 -0400
committer Sarah M Brown <brownsarahm@uri.edu> 1665005715 -0400

first commit
```

Next we write a tree object from the staging area

```
git write-tree
```

```
163b45f0a0925b0655da232ea8a4188ccec615f5
```

```
git cat-file -p 163b4
```

```
100644 blob fa49b077972391ad58037050f2a75f74e3671e92	new.txt
100644 blob 0c1e7391ca4e59584f8b773ecdbbb9467eba1547	test.txt
```
This tree has the current version of each file.  

Now we can make a new commit.  We will echo the message into the commit-tree plumbing function with a pipr and then we will tell this commit to point to the tree we just created and that its parent is the first commit.

```
echo "second commit" | git commit-tree 163b4 -p e0913
```

```
cf857a865c6088ab9bf90e2732df967f8e2582ab
```

But still when we check status
```
git status
```

```
On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   new.txt
	new file:   test.txt

```
The files look staged.  This is beacuse of what `git status` does.  It compares the current working directory (what we see when we do ls) to the staging area and the content that the current branch points to.



```
find .git/objects -type f
```

```
.git/objects/0c/1e7391ca4e59584f8b773ecdbbb9467eba1547
.git/objects/d6/70460b4b4aece5915caf5c68d12f560a9fe3e4
.git/objects/d8/329fc1cc938780ffdd9f94e0d364e0ea74f579
.git/objects/cf/857a865c6088ab9bf90e2732df967f8e2582ab
.git/objects/16/3b45f0a0925b0655da232ea8a4188ccec615f5
.git/objects/fa/49b077972391ad58037050f2a75f74e3671e92
.git/objects/e0/9139a38f4fd6d82715c32aab9adfed67a87ba5
.git/objects/83/baae61804e65cc73a7201a7252750c76066a30
```


## Git References

Recall the `.git` directory has many other files in it.

```
ls .git
```

```
HEAD		description	index		objects
config		hooks		info		refs
```

Let's look at the refs dir.
```
ls .git/refs/
```

```
heads	tags
```


```
ls .git/refs/heads
```

```
```
there's nothing in the heads dir

Though when we use `git status`

```
git status
```

```
On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   new.txt
	new file:   test.txt

```
we see it is "on main" this is because we set the branch to main , but since we have not written there, we have to do it directly. Notice that when we use the porcelain command for commit, it does this automatically; the porcelain commands do many things.

We can write tothat file directly
```
echo cf857a865c6088ab9bf90e2732df967f8e2582ab > .git/refs/heads/main
```

And now if we check git status

```
git status
```

```
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```
we see what we expec.

Alternatively, we can use only a short reference to the hash if we use `git update-ref`

```
git update-ref refs/heads/main cf857
```

Now git log also works.

```
git log
```

```
commit cf857a865c6088ab9bf90e2732df967f8e2582ab (HEAD -> main)

    second commit

    first commit
```

Lets create a branch at the point of our first commit.

```
git update-ref refs/heads/test e0913
```

```
git log
```

```
commit cf857a865c6088ab9bf90e2732df967f8e2582ab (HEAD -> main)
Author: Sarah M Brown <brownsarahm@uri.edu>

    second commit

commit e09139a38f4fd6d82715c32aab9adfed67a87ba5 (test)
Author: Sarah M Brown <brownsarahm@uri.edu>
Date:   Wed Oct 5 17:35:15 2022 -0400

    first commit
```

Notice that the commit history in `git log` also lists the branches.

We can also look at the HEAD pointer
```
git symbolic-ref HEAD
```

```
refs/heads/main
```


update the HEAD directly
```
git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/test
```
and see what this does.

```
git status
```

```
On branch test
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   new.txt
	modified:   test.txt

```

This is only part of what `git checkout` does, because it switches the branch, but does not update the working directory.

## Git Tags

Just like branches, but used differently.

```
ls .git/refs/
```

```
heads	tags
```


```
git update-ref refs/tags/v1.0
```

```
usage: git update-ref [<options>] -d <refname> [<old-val>]
   or: git update-ref [<options>]    <refname> <new-val> [<old-val>]
   or: git update-ref [<options>] --stdin [-z]

    -m <reason>           reason of the update
    -d                    delete the reference
    --no-deref            update <refname> not the one it points to
    -z                    stdin has NUL-terminated arguments
    --stdin               read updates from stdin
    --create-reflog       create a reflog

```


```
git update-ref refs/tags/v1.0 cf857a
```

```
```


```
git checkout main
```

```
Switched to branch 'main'
```


```
git log
```

```

## Adding a remote

We created this repo locally, and we have not set a remote.
```
git remote
```

we can add one with

```
git remote add origin <url/to/remote>
```

in my case, I'll use `https://github.com/introcompsys/toy-repo-brownsarahm.git` you should use your own.


```
git remote
```

```
origin
```


```
ls .git
```

```
HEAD		description	index		logs		refs
config		hooks		info		objects
```


```
ls .git/config
```

```
.git/config
```


```
cat .git/config
```

```
[core]
	repositoryformatversion = 0
	filemode = true
	bare = false
	logallrefupdates = true
	ignorecase = true
	precomposeunicode = true
[remote "origin"]
	url = https://github.com/introcompsys/toy-repo-brownsarahm.git
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
```


```
git push
```

```
fatal: The current branch main has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin main

```
adding a remote directly doesn't link the local branch to the remote branch, so we do that next.

```
git push -u origin main
```
