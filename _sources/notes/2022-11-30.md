# Programming Languages

Today we'll explore how programming languages are cateogrized. Along the way, this will expose what core, generic features of a programming language are.  

The key takeaway that I want for your is to have intution for how to choose a language for a project, not only your favorite, but what is the best for different types of projects.

```{tip}
You should do *either* the `in groups` or the `on your own` sections below for the x.x.x for the x.x sections do all of them.

##  Comparing languages you know

### In groups

Start by sharing the prepare task where you made a table comparing tow languages on some features with some classmates and then discuss how thy are similar and different.  

Together, produce a list of questions for what other things you would want to know about how programming languages compare.  


### On your own

Post your table and a question on GitHub. Reply to at least two peers offering either advice or asking additional questions.  

After reading other tables, add in your kwl repo below your table some notes on broader patterns.
