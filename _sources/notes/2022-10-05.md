# How does git *really* work?



## Creating a repo from scratch

We will start in the top level course directory.
```
cd systems
ls
```
Mine looks like this:
```
2022-09-19			courseutils			github-inclass-brownsarahm
```
Yours should also have your kwl repo, group repo, etc.  


We can create an empty repo from scratch using `git init`

```
git init test
```

```
hint: Using 'master' as the name for the initial branch. This default branch name
hint: is subject to change. To configure the initial branch name to use in all
hint: of your new repositories, which will suppress this warning, call:
hint:
hint: 	git config --global init.defaultBranch <name>
hint:
hint: Names commonly chosen instead of 'master' are 'main', 'trunk' and
hint: 'development'. The just-created branch can be renamed via this command:
hint:
hint: 	git branch -m <name>
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/brownsarahm/Documents/inclass/systems/test/.git/
```

It creates a folder and gives us a warning about branch names.  If you have a new install you will not see this, because new versions of git have this by default.

fundamentlaly the default branch is not special. you can name it whatever you want.


Historically it was called master.

[derived from a master/slave analogy](https://mail.gnome.org/archives/desktop-devel-list/2019-May/msg00066.html) which is not even how git works, but was adopted terminology from other projects

[GitHub no longer does](https://github.com/github/renaming)

[the broader community is as well](https://sfconservancy.org/news/2020/jun/23/gitbranchname/)

[git allows you to make your default not be master](https://lore.kernel.org/git/pull.656.v4.git.1593009996.gitgitgadget@gmail.com/)

[literally the person who chose the names "master" and "origin" regrets that choice](https://twitter.com/xpasky/status/1271477451756056577) the name main is a more accurate and not harmful term and the current convention.  

```
ls
```
we can see that we hav ea new directory
```
2022-09-19			github-inclass-brownsarahm
courseutils			test
```

Now we want to change the name of the default branch

```
git branch -m main
```

```
fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
```
but we have to cd into it first.

```
cd test/
```


```
git branch -m main
```


```
git status
```

```
On branch main

No commits yet

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
```
and we have a completely empty repo.

```
ls .git/
```

```
HEAD		description	info		refs
config		hooks		objects
```
we've looked at most of these, but we have not been able to see the objects before.  We will work with those now.

## Searching the file system

We can use the bash command `find` to search the file *system* note that this does not search the **contents** of the files, just the names.

```
find .git/objects
```

we have a few items in that directory and the directory itself.

```
.git/objects
.git/objects/pack
.git/objects/info
```

We can limit by type, to only files with the `-type` option set to `f`

```
find .git/objects -type f
```

And we have no results. We have no objects yet.
```
```

## Git Objects

There are 3 types:
- blob objects: the content of your files (data)
- tree objects: stores file names and groups files together (organization)
- Commit Objects: stores information about the sha values of the snapshots


Let's create our first one.  git uses hashes as the key. We give the hashing function some content, it applies the algorithm and returns us the hash as the reference to that object.  We can also write to our database wit this.
```
echo "test content" | git hash-object -w --stdin
```


- git hash-object would take the content you handed to it and merely return the unique key
- w option then tells the command to also write that object to the database
- --stdin option tells git hash-object to get the content to be processed from stdin instead of a file
- the `|` is called a pipe (what we saw before was a redirect) it pipes a _process_ output into the next command
- echo would write to stdout, withthe pip it passes that to std in of the git-hash

```{important}
pipes are an important content too. we're seeing them in context of real uses, and we will keep seing them. Pipes connec tthe std out of one command t othe std in of the next.
```

we get back the hash:
```
d670460b4b4aece5915caf5c68d12f560a9fe3e4
```

and we can check if it wrote to the database.

```
find .git/objects -type f
```

```
.git/objects/d6/70460b4b4aece5915caf5c68d12f560a9fe3e4
```

and we see a file that it was supposed to have!

We can use `cat-file` to use the object by referencing at least 4 characters that are unique from the full hash, not the file name. (`70460` will not work)

```
git cat-file -p d6704
```

`cat-file` requires *an* option `-p` is for pretty print

```
test content
```

we see it stored the contet we expected.


```
cat .git/objects/d6/70460b4b4aece5915caf5c68d12f560a9fe3e4
```

but without `git`'s `cat-file`' we cannot read that file.
```
xK??OR04f(I-.QH??+I?+?K?	```
```

## Hashing a file

let's create a file

```
echo 'version 1' > test.txt
```

and store it in our database, by hashing it

```
git hash-object -w test.txt
```

```
83baae61804e65cc73a7201a7252750c76066a30
```

we can look at what we have.

```
find .git/objects -type f
```

```
.git/objects/d6/70460b4b4aece5915caf5c68d12f560a9fe3e4
.git/objects/83/baae61804e65cc73a7201a7252750c76066a30
```

and what is in the working directory.  
```
ls
```

```
test.txt
```

```{note}
the workign directory and the git repo are not strictly the same thing, and can be different like this.  Mostly they will stay in closer relationship that we currently have unless we use plumbling commands, but it is good to build a solid understanding of how the `.git` directory relates to your working directory.
```

## Writing to the index

So far, even though we have hashed the object, git still thinks the file is untracked, because it is not in the tree and there are no commits that point to that part of the tree.
```
git status
```

```
On branch main

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	test.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

First, let's edit the file

```
echo 'version 2' >> test.txt
```

so it looks like this:

```
cat test.txt
```

```
version 1
version 2
```

and then hash the new version of the file too.
```
git hash-object -w test.txt
```


````{margin}
```{note}
all of the hashes we have so far, are the same for all of us and are repeatable.  Try making a new repo with a different name and repeating these steps, same hashes every time.
```

```{admonition} Deeper Exploration idea
What changes would make the hashes different
```
````

```
0c1e7391ca4e59584f8b773ecdbbb9467eba1547
```

And we can look at our objects again

```
find .git/objects -type f
```

```
.git/objects/0c/1e7391ca4e59584f8b773ecdbbb9467eba1547
.git/objects/d6/70460b4b4aece5915caf5c68d12f560a9fe3e4
.git/objects/83/baae61804e65cc73a7201a7252750c76066a30
```
We have the string we wrote directly and the two versions of the file.

we can verify the last one that we have not looked at yet.

```
git cat-file -p 0c1e
```

```
version 1
version 2
```

TO add this to the index

````{margin}
```{note}
the `\` here allows for line wrapping
```
````

```
git update-index --add --cacheinfo 100644 \
  83baae61804e65cc73a7201a7252750c76066a30 test.txt
```


- this the plumbing command `git update-index` updates (or in this case creates an index, the staging area of our repository)
- the `--add` option is because the file doesn’t yet exist in our staging area (we don’t even have a staging area set up yet)
- `--cacheinfo` because the file we're adding isn’t in your directory but is in the database.
- in this case, we’re specifying a mode of 100644, which means it’s a normal file.
- then the hash object we want to add to the index (the content) in our case, we want the hash of the first version of the file, not the most recent one.
- finally the file name of that content


Now let's see what git knows:

```
git status
```

```
On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   test.txt

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   test.txt

```

We added the first version of the file to the staging area, so that version is ready to commit  but we have changed the version in our working directory relative to the version from the hash object that we put in the staging area so we *also* have changes not staged.

we can see what those changes are with `git diff`

```
git diff test.txt
```

```
diff --git a/test.txt b/test.txt
index 83baae6..0c1e739 100644
--- a/test.txt
+++ b/test.txt
@@ -1 +1,2 @@
version 1
+version 2
```
the first few lines tell us what git is doing; it says that it is comparing the content
at hash 83baae6 to hash 0c1e739 (as expected, 83baae6 is the one we put in the index; 0c1e739 is the last thing we hashed, which is also still what is our working directory)

the next three lines say that we the a one is missing lines relative to the b one and a quantitative desription.

the last two lines are the file with changes between the two versions marked the second version has "version 2" added to it relative to the first one.

## Creating a commit manually

We can echo a commit message through a pip into the commit-tree plumbing function to cmmit a particular hashed object.

```
echo "first commit" | git commit-tree 83baa
```

```
fatal: 83baae61804e65cc73a7201a7252750c76066a30 is not a valid 'tree' object
```
But we can actually only commit `tree` objects

we have

```
find .git/objects -type f
```

```
.git/objects/0c/1e7391ca4e59584f8b773ecdbbb9467eba1547
.git/objects/d6/70460b4b4aece5915caf5c68d12f560a9fe3e4
.git/objects/83/baae61804e65cc73a7201a7252750c76066a30
```

the `-t` option of cat-file can tell us the type:
```
git cat-file 0c1e -t
```

```
blob
```

```
git cat-file d6704 -t
```

```
blob
```

```
git cat-file 83baa -t
```

```
blob
```
These are all blob objects, the actual *content* that we are storing

we can write a tree though:

```
git write-tree
```

```
d8329fc1cc938780ffdd9f94e0d364e0ea74f579
```

and look at this:


```
git cat-file -p d8329
```

```
100644 blob 83baae61804e65cc73a7201a7252750c76066a30	test.txt
```

and check its type:

```
git cat-file -t d8329
```

```
tree
```
Now that we hav ea tree object we can commit the tree.

```
echo "first commit" | git commit-tree d8329
```

```
e09139a38f4fd6d82715c32aab9adfed67a87ba5
```

and we get back a hash. But notice that this hash is unique for each of us. Because the commit has information about the time stamp and our user.  The above hash is the one I got during class, but when I re-ran this while typing the notes I got a different hash (`d450567fec96cbd8dd514313db9bcb96ad7664b0`) even though I have the same name and e-mail because the time changed.


```{important}
verify that you have the same git status and list of objects as below
```

```
git status
```

```
On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   test.txt

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   test.txt

```


```
find .git/objects -type f
```

```
.git/objects/0c/1e7391ca4e59584f8b773ecdbbb9467eba1547
.git/objects/d6/70460b4b4aece5915caf5c68d12f560a9fe3e4
.git/objects/d8/329fc1cc938780ffdd9f94e0d364e0ea74f579
.git/objects/e0/9139a38f4fd6d82715c32aab9adfed67a87ba5
.git/objects/83/baae61804e65cc73a7201a7252750c76066a30
```
we will all have 4 of the same objects and one unique one.

```{admonition} Further Reading
The goal of this exercise is to take an ethnographic approach to understanding the IDE(s) you use most often.
We will combine this with a more formal study of them soon. Approaching a topic through multiple lenses can help you understand it better and presenting you, as a group, with multiple ways is a strategy of mine to help make sure that every one of you finds *at least* one way that works for you.

## Questions After Class

### Would any of the pull requests we make in class count towards the Hacktoberfest requirements?

The PRs to your group and KWL repos will not, because those are private. I will make it so that contributions to the course website can count.  To be honest, I will only give you each one qualifying PR to the course site for Hacktoberfest.  

I will also though make the courseutils repo qualify and create some issues there to outline improvements to it that I want to make.  That would require some python knowledge too.  

The Hacktoberfest [participation](https://hacktoberfest.com/participation/) page also has links to good repos to contribute to.


### how do you make a local repo that's private on github?

We will push this repo from beign created locally to GitHub next week.

### Are hash algorithms supposed to always output a unique value?

Yes for each content you put in, it should gibe a unique output.  If you put the same content in, most of the time you want a repeatable hashing function

### How did you set up the courseutils for tracking. I just want to know out of curiosity.

It's a [public repo](https://github.com/introcompsys/courseutils) of python code that I made installable.  You can look at the source code if you would like.  If you have questions, you can post an issue there or use office hours.

### are hash objects exclusively backend mechanics, or can we use our knowledge of them to our advantage”
