# How can I fix things in git?


## Moving a Commit

Start on your main branch of your github in class repo with a clean working directory

```
git status
```

```
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

Now let's create a new file

```
touch new_feature.md
```

and add commit and push it to the main branch


```
git add .
```

```
```


```
git comit -m "new feature"
```


```
git commit -m "new feature"
```

```
[main 0830c39] new feature
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 new_feature.md
```


```
git push
```

We had wanted to make a new feature but we realize that our work is on the main branch, not a separate feature branch.

Fortunately, we can fix it!

```
git status
```

```
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

We can reset the the staging area and undo the last commit (remove the commit itself, but not the changes) to the last state that the staging area had with

```
git reset HEAD^
```

we can see what this did with

```
git status
```

```
On branch main
Your branch is behind 'origin/main' by 1 commit, and can be fast-forwarded.
  (use "git pull" to update your local branch)

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	new_feature.md

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

Our file is still there, it is now not in the git commit history and the changes are back in the staging area.

Now we can switch branches

```
git checkout -b new_feature
```



```
Switched to a new branch 'new_feature'
```

and confirm

```
git status
```

```
On branch new_feature
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	new_feature.md

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

and then commit to the new branch.  

```
git add .
git commit -m ' new feature ready for PR'
```

```
[new_feature a399978]  new feature ready for PR
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 new_feature.md
```
Remember branches are pointers, so what we did was remove the commit (but not the snapshot) from a commit to the main branch (with info about main in it) to a new branch. This leave the main branch pointer pointed at the previous commit and moves only the new branch to the new commit.  We get a new hash because the time and commit message are different, but the content is the same.

```
git push
```

```
fatal: The current branch new_feature has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin new_feature

```


```
git push --set-upstream origin new_feature
```

Our changes are not here locally, but they still are on GitHub

```
ls
```

```
README.md	about.md
```
We can try to push our local to GitHub

```
git push
```

```
To https://github.com/introcompsys/github-inclass-brownsarahm.git

hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.
hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.

```
but it does not work because this is will result in losing information, git (and GitHub) will not let you lose information by accident.

the `-f` option stands for force and makes it do things that we otherwise might not want to/

```
git push -f

```


```

## merging

We can merge offline too


```
git merge new_feature main

## Reverting changes

We can undo *changes* by picking out a specific commit by its name.
First elts make two changes and commit eahc.

```
echo "change 1" >> new_feature.md
git add .
git commit -m 'change 1'
```

```
[main 83690bc] change 1
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```


```
echo "change 2" >> new_feature.md
git add .
git commit -m 'change 2'
```

```
[main 948eda1] change 2
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

SO we hav e a file with two  chagnes
```
cat new_feature.md
```

```
change 1
change 2
```

We need to know the hash of the commit that we want to undo.
```
git log
```

```

```

We use git revert
```
git revert 83690bc
```

```
Auto-merging new_feature.md
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in new_feature.md
error: could not revert 83690bc... change 1
hint: After resolving the conflicts, mark them with
hint: "git add/rm <pathspec>", then run
hint: "git revert --continue".
hint: You can instead skip this commit with "git revert --skip".
hint: To abort and get back to the state before "git revert",
hint: run "git revert --abort".
```

In this case, we get a merge conflict becaues the file was so simple before, git cannot be sure how to undo that small change.

```
cat new_feature.md
```

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
change 1
change 2
=======
>>>>>>> parent of 83690bc (change 1)
```


```
nano new_feature.md
```

we can use nano to resolve the merge conflict. and then check

```
git status
```

```
On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 3 commits.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

You are currently reverting commit 83690bc.
  (fix conflicts and run "git revert --continue")
  (use "git revert --skip" to skip this patch)
  (use "git revert --abort" to cancel the revert operation)

Unmerged paths:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
  (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)
	both modified:   new_feature.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

we have to add and commit to finish
```
git add .
```

```
```


```
git status
```

```
On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 3 commits.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

You are currently reverting commit 83690bc.
  (all conflicts fixed: run "git revert --continue")
  (use "git revert --skip" to skip this patch)
  (use "git revert --abort" to cancel the revert operation)

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	modified:   new_feature.md

```


```
git commit -m "revert chang 1"
```

```
[main c1807f4] revert chang 1
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
```


```
git status
```
and then we are all set.

```
On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 4 commits.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

We can see git revert undoes the *changes* but **adds* an additional comit, it is keeping track of every change and by default the commit history only moves forward.

```
git log

### Trouble shooting

If anaconda or miniconda is installed: `conda activate`. Otherwise activate a python environment of your choosing

Try pulling updates and reinstalling.

Make sure you reactive bash.

try both `pip` and `pip3`

## Questions After Class

### Will the use of the courseutils and commands be necessary for the class? or would it just make the class easier?
They're for tracking your progress. We will help you get it working or work around it.

### My kwlfilecheck command is still not working how do I fix that?

There's a missing section on the course website for that command, focus on getting `sysgetassignment` for now.  Try the things above and if it still does not create a detailed issue with what error you get and what OS you are using on the [repo](https://github.com/introcompsys/courseutils)

### Can you post directions for how to get the kwl tracking to work on m1 macs

[ a student did this last year](https://github.com/introcompsys/courseutils/issues/1)

### Does a flash drive that I have made to have ubuntu in 2017 works?  

yes
