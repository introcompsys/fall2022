1. Make notes on _how_ you use IDEs for the next couple of weeks using the template file in the course notes (will provide prompts and tips). We will come back to these notes in class later, but it is best to record over a time period instead of trying to remember at that time. Store your notes in your kwl repo in `idethoughts.md` on an `ide_prep` branch.
2. make sure that you have a `test` git repo that matches the notes.
```{index} idethoughts.md
```
