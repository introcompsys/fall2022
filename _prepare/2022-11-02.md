1. In `fractionalbinary.md` use 8 bits to represent the following points where 4 bits are >1 and the other 4 bits are 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16th:
- 3.75
- 7.5
- 11.625
- 5.1875
1. Add to your file some note about the limitations of representing non integer values this way. How much would using more bits help with, what limitations are not resolved y adding more bits.
