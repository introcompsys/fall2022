1. Read [gates out of anything](https://hackaday.com/2017/01/03/make-logic-gates-out-of-almost-anything/) and watch the [marble adder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcDshWmhF4A). Create `gates.md` and answer the questions below:

    ```
    1. What do all of the gates described have in common?
    1. How does the marble adder compare to the half adder?
    ```
1. Study the [8 bit ALU](https://lodev.org/logicemu/#id=alu). Try it out and be prepared to answer questions about it in class.  Some questions to guide your exploration: What can it do? Try to compare it to the adder that we have seen. What components does it have that we have not yet seen? How does it represent different operations?
