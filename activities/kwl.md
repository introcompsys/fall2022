# KWL Chart

(kwlworkflows)=
## Working with your KWL Repo

```{important}
The `main` branch should only contain material that has been reviewed and approved by the instructors.
```

````{margin}
```{tip}
You could apply branch protections on your feedback branch if you like
```
````


1. Work on a specific branch for each activity you work on
1. when it is ready for review, create a PR from the item-specifc branch to `main`.
1. when it is approved, merge into main.

<!--
```{tip}
After your KWL repo is a jupyterbook, you may want to move your chart into a chart.md from the README. You could then put content from this section in the README to have an in-place reminder.
``` -->
