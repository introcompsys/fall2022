this counts as two days of more practice

1. Make a pull request to the course website with advice to a future student
1. add `group_contributions_final.json` to your kwl repo with all of your group contributions including the title, and url
1. add `peer_review.json to your kwl` repo with a listing of the pull requests that you provided a review for.
1. Create `in_five_years.md` and answer the following two questions: What do you think you will remember from this class in five years? What parts of this course's content do you think will change the most in five years?
```{index} group_contributions_final.json
```
```{index} peer_review.json
```
```{index} in_five_years.md
```
