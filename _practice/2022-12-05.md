1. Make a table that compares and contrasts the unix file system to git *as* a file system on at least 5 aspects (eg header + 5 rows) in `filesystem.md`. Based on this, write a definition of a file system generally and how knowing that these are both file systems helps reinforce concepts and improve understanding.
1. In `whypointers.md` write a blog-post style argument for why understanding pointers as a concept is important for a computer science student even if they will not work directly in a language that uses pointers.  Consider your audience to be a student who is in CSC212 and struggling. Use two examples from this class where we relied on the concept of pointers to explain how something worked.
1. Reflect on how this course impacts programming/debugging skills in `skillup.md`.  You can write this as how you think your own skill has improved **or** as if you are convincing another student to take this class. Touch on at least three topics.
```{index} filesystem.md
```
```{index}whypointers.md
```
```{index}skillup.md
```
