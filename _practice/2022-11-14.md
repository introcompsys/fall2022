1. (priority) While we saw many types of gates today, but we actually could get all of the operations needed using only NAND gates. Work out how to use NAND gates to implement a half adder and describe it in `nandhalf.md`
1. In `addertypes.md` compare ripple adders and lookahead adders.
    ```
    1. Give a synopsis of each adder type
    1. Compare them in terms of time (assume that each gate requires one unite of time)
    1. Compare them in terms of space/cost by counting the total number of gates required.
