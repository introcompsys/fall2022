 NASA's initial setup computers



 was rooms full of people with small talk to you later and they were doing all the calculations were being paid the jobs they were doing the

 the computers in to take it over and do the actual like get the numbers out yes that was a next question so women were computers man were mathematicians if women went to college and got like a bachelor's degree in math they could then we'll be a computer and work

 what the mathematicians were all men about time which is not pleasant I feel like cringing discomfort like tensions but that's what the women were computers that's all the way

 because when NASA and other places started buying actual physical machine computers people who have been doing the calculations were then taught to



part of that movie's plot is that they got the computer and then they actually the first ones who became proficient with those particular computer is on that particular site in Virginia and the others left, and all that stuff but

<p>other like it was a lot of applications it was also like the Manhattan Project was one of the things that motivated them like this is why we need to build a lot of calculations and then later at the end of the 56 the Moon that was also a lot of math like we need to make sure these Rockets can like go up and come back down the way we expect them to</p>

<p>what is the mechanical calculator it works by like incrementing it doesn’t do the logic like they took not a binary representation it’s not adding via input two numbers and then it goes forward its where’s my income as you put in one number then you can add the next number and it kind of works the wheels have like the numbers on them and it uses like 9 supplement to carry over to the next bit so there’s a gear that when it hits a certain point that turns the next year and then it goes for it any Castles in the Sky why the semi did</p>
<p><strong>Why did he make this?</strong></p>
<p>He was 18 and  his father was a tax commissioner in France and he wanted to like reduce his father’s workload</p>

<p>During this time small, lots of small computers were made, but each was made completely by its creators, there was no standards, per say.</p>
<p>These computers were also stored program computers. Meaning their operation at a program level was fixed by the circuitry.</p>
<p>switch the circuit to do different things between the numbers so this would get us bitwise operations of an indoor and outdoor on our numbers</p>
<p>we had the first program later this eniac computer</p>
<p>which athlete came out certainty 43 wasn’t finished for a little while this this all this is one computer and see there’s several people in this room doing this one computer this was programmed manually like changing the circuits because it helped me had and that point in time they only had read-only memory you could put something into memory we don’t have memory like what kind of memory that you could keep when you said the power off for a long time what’s the powers off then what was that whatever was in Army was on and all we had was just reading the numbers you could program the computer stuff is working out to do the thing we’re going to do and then you could go do that calculation many times you needed an Ordy bug a program that it took weeks to value of all experience the pain of debugging rarely it takes two weeks to debug one error correct</p>
<p>right yes maybe it hurts sometimes it’s like a long night not enough sleep but like this week’s of like moving cables did anyone get his memory we need some way about you storing things and writing things down and we need a way that actually can store memory that first they do more vacuum tubes do the same sort of switching on and off with store stuff but the problem with that is the power off</p>
<p>so but this</p>
<p>stored program computers they only had read only memory and eventually we got random access memory which we could write and read and change whenever we wanted</p>
<p>which we can have including storage without power</p>
<p>so and not but we have three types of places we store information we got registers which store information that is currently being processed so we look back at our circuits these inputs here we’re turning onto just as B were treating them as switches but these are actually implemented as register if you have a register at the input and a register register the input for each of the inputs to b l u r i a registered but it’s only live it’s got some number of bits in it so see if you’re paying attention and putting things together we talked about a computer system having like operating doing some type of some type of a b s what device stores that many bits</p>
<p>Dell computers we have</p>
<p>so what what is Ashley’s what is the thing that has that number of bits is a limitation of the device equipment stores at me I guess I should have changed the options but we’ll go look what it is</p>

<p>what else do we need besides ALU for to have like a whole computer</p>
<p>we eventually need clocks to time things and synchronize things to like know when to clear and when to change so that you if you want to do multiple things in sequence you can do that what else you need or want to do multiple things in sequence but don’t know what else we need a general now</p>
<p>store more insturctions and data</p>

<p>theater image put the volume in architecture</p>
<p>was from 1945 was written by people at 10 and this is basically how we still design computers for the most part we have you control unit</p>
<p>some memory and some registers together all of these things or the CPU</p>
<p>these can talk to Ram which is memory random-access memory so this is a memory that can be changed any time we want it Amanda storage or hard drive which is now not as physically different from these two but that’s there</p>
<p>In 1945 we get a draft of a general template. This is basically what we use today.</p>

<p>They are various registers that each have a specific role.  Learning all of these these in more detail is a good Deeper Exploration or a single one is in more practice.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">20.9.4. </span>When defining a computer, is it best to define the most current model of a computer? Or how everything functions bare bones?<a class="headerlink" href="#when-defining-a-computer-is-it-best-to-define-the-most-current-model-of-a-computer-or-how-everything-functions-bare-bones" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>What definition dependsd on the context.  If you are talking to a child who is trying to learn basic typing they need to know different things than a teenager trying to choose what type of comptuer to bring to college, which is different than the model you need to keep in mind when you’re working in a high level language, which is different than what you need when you are writing drivers.</p>

<p>Quantum computers operate on a fundamentally different object, instead of bits they have <a class="reference external" href="https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/composer/docs/iqx/guide/the-qubit">qubits</a>.  There represent, essetially some uncertainty, or randomness in the behavior, so then there are different operations needed.</p>
