# What happens when I build code in C?


## What is *buiding* code?

Building is transforming code from the input format to the final format.  

This can mean different things in different contexts. For example:
- the course website is built from markdown files in to html output
- a C program is built from source code to executables

We sometimes say that compiling takes code from source to executable, but this process is actually multiple stages and compiling is *one* of those steps.



We will focus on *what* has to happen more than *how* it all happens.  

CSC301, 402, 501, 502 go into greater detail on how languages work.  

Our goal is to:

- (where applicable) give you a preview
- get enough understanding of what happens to know where to look when debugging


## An overview


![flowchart of prepreproces, compile, assemble, link](https://miro.medium.com/max/1036/1*wHKe6W4opLmk6pb7sxZz6w.png)

[source](https://medium.com/@laura.derohan/compiling-c-files-with-gcc-step-by-step-8e78318052)


## Setup for today


```
mkdir compilec
cd compilec/
```

```
ls
```

```
```
we have an empty folder. This will be importatnt.

```
nano hello.c
```

And we'll paste in the following
```C
#include <stdio.h>

void main () {
 printf("Hello world\n");
}
```



```
cat hello.c
```

```
#include <stdio.h>

void main () {
 printf("Hello world\n");
}
```


```
ls
```

```
hello.c
```
we have a single file

## Preprocessing with gcc

First we handle the preprocessing which pulls in headers that are included.  We will use the compiler
[gcc](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/gcc.1.html)

```
gcc -E hello.c -o hello.i
```

- `-E` stops after preprocessing
- `-o` makes it write the .i file and passes the file name for it


If it succeeds, we see no output, but we can check the folder

```
ls
```

now we have a new file

```
hello.c	hello.i
```

This file is much longer than the one we started with


```bash
cat hello.i |wc -l
```

```
     542
```


```bash
cat hello.c |wc -l
```

```
       5
```

So we will look at only a few rows here.

````{margin}
```{admonition} Try it yourself
Look at this whole file, try changing the base program to remove the include and then see what the preprocessed file is like
```

```{note}
I have set this cell to use C syntax highlighting even though on a terminal output it would not
```
````

```
cat hello.i | head -n 10
```

```C
# 1 "hello.c"
# 1 "<built-in>" 1
# 1 "<built-in>" 3
# 366 "<built-in>" 3
# 1 "<command line>" 1
# 1 "<built-in>" 2
# 1 "hello.c" 2
# 1 "/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include/stdio.h" 1 3 4
# 64 "/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include/stdio.h" 3 4
# 1 "/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include/_stdio.h" 1 3 4
```
This gives us a version with the header file's contents literally pasted in to replace the original `#include` statement

and at the bottom
```
cat hello.i | tail -n 10
```

is our original program

```C


extern int __vsnprintf_chk (char * restrict, size_t, int, size_t,
       const char * restrict, va_list);
# 408 "/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include/stdio.h" 2 3 4
# 2 "hello.c" 2

void main () {
 printf("Hello world\n");
}
```

At the bottom of the file, we see the original code with an extra bit of information that helps the compiler write better error messages, by saying where contents came from.

## Compiling

Next we take our preprocessed file and compile it to get assembly code.


```
gcc -S hello.i
```

- `-S` tells it to produce assembly

```
hello.c:3:1: warning: return type of 'main' is not 'int' [-Wmain-return-type]
void main () {
^
hello.c:3:1: note: change return type to 'int'
void main () {
^~~~
int
1 warning generated.
```

We got a warning, but that is okay

```
ls
```
and then we have a new file as well:

```
hello.c	hello.i	hello.s
```

The assembly code is also readable

```
cat hello.s
```

There are many more steps and they are lower level programs, but it is text stored in the file.
```
	.section	__TEXT,__text,regular,pure_instructions
	.build_version macos, 10, 15, 6	sdk_version 10, 15, 6
	.globl	_main                   ## -- Begin function main
	.p2align	4, 0x90
_main:                                  ## @main
	.cfi_startproc
## %bb.0:
	pushq	%rbp
	.cfi_def_cfa_offset 16
	.cfi_offset %rbp, -16
	movq	%rsp, %rbp
	.cfi_def_cfa_register %rbp
	leaq	L_.str(%rip), %rdi
	movb	$0, %al
	callq	_printf
	popq	%rbp
	retq
	.cfi_endproc
                                        ## -- End function
	.section	__TEXT,__cstring,cstring_literals
L_.str:                                 ## @.str
	.asciz	"Hello world\n"

.subsections_via_symbols
```

This is like the assembly code we saw in the hardware simulator, but this is the fully expressive assembly language that our computers use, not the toy one for the simulator.
````{margin}
```{hint}
Learning more about assembly is a good deeper exploration
```
````

## Assembling


Assembling is to take the assembly code and get object code.  Assembly is relatively broad and there are families of assembly code, it is also still written *for humans* to understand it readily.  It's more complex than source code because it is closer to the hardware.  The object code however, is specific instructions to your machine and not human readable.



```
gcc -c hello.s -o hello.o
```

- `-c` tells it to stop at the object file
- `-o` again gives it the name of the file to write


```
ls
```

```
hello.c	hello.i	hello.o	hello.s
```
now we see a new file, the `.o`


let's look at it
```
cat hello.o
```
This is not machine readable, though:

```
<__compact_unwind__LD( P?__eh_frame__TEXTH@p
                                            h2

??
  PUH??H?=	??]?Hello world
zRx
-_main_printf```
```
MacOS tried to help a little but it's still not very readable.


## Linking

Now we can link it all together; in this program there are not a lot of other depdencies, but this fills in anything from libraries and outputs an executble



```
gcc -o hello hello.o -lm
```

-  `-o` flag specifies the name for output
-  `-lm` tells it to link from the .o file.

again we can look at the directory

```
ls
```
we have a new executable file
```
hello	hello.c	hello.i	hello.o	hello.s
```

We can see that the file as execute permissions:


```
ls -la
```

```
total 176
drwxr-xr-x   7 brownsarahm  staff    224 Oct 31 16:57 .
drwxr-xr-x  11 brownsarahm  staff    352 Oct 31 16:42 ..
-rwxr-xr-x   1 brownsarahm  staff  49424 Oct 31 16:57 hello
-rw-r--r--   1 brownsarahm  staff     63 Oct 31 16:44 hello.c
-rw-r--r--   1 brownsarahm  staff  22932 Oct 31 16:45 hello.i
-rw-r--r--   1 brownsarahm  staff    760 Oct 31 16:52 hello.o
-rw-r--r--   1 brownsarahm  staff    647 Oct 31 16:49 hello.s
```


Finally we can run our program

```
./hello
```

```
Hello world
```

## Putting it all together

We can also do all of it at once, to see how it's different let's clean up the directory:
```
rm hello.i hello.s hello.o
```



```
ls
```

```
hello.c
```

and now we can tell it to compile and link

````{margin}
```{note}
we can put parameters in different orders, they're all options (like passing by name in python)
```
````
```
gcc -Wall -g -o hello hello.c -lm
```

```
hello.c:3:1: warning: return type of 'main' is not 'int' [-Wmain-return-type]
void main () {
^
hello.c:3:1: note: change return type to 'int'
void main () {
^~~~
int
1 warning generated.
```



```
ls
```

```
hello		hello.c		hello.dSYM
```
we have the file again as expected.

## Working with multiple files

```
nano main.c
```


```C
/* Used to illustrate separate compilation.

Created: Joe Zachary, October 22, 1992
Modified:

*/

#include <stdio.h>

void main () {
 int n;
 printf("Please enter a small positive integer: ");
 scanf("%d", &n);
 printf("The sum of the first n integers is %d\n", sum(n));
 printf("The product of the first n integers is %d\n", product(n));
}
```


```
nano help.c
```


```C
/* Used to illustrate separate compilation

Created: Joe Zachary, October 22, 1992
Modified:

*/


/* Requires that "n" be positive. Returns the sum of the
  first "n" integers. */

int sum (int n) {
 int i;
 int total = 0;
 for (i = 1; i <= n; i++)
  total += i;
 return(total);
}


/* Requires that "n" be positive. Returns the product of the
  first "n" integers. */

int product (int n) {
 int i;
 int total = 1;
 for (i = 1; i <= n; i++)
  total *= i;
 return(total);
}
```

```
ls
```

```
hello		hello.c		hello.dSYM	help.c		main.c
```

First we can make the two objects:
```
gcc -Wall -g -c main.c
```
but here we get an error:
```
main.c:10:1: warning: return type of 'main' is not 'int' [-Wmain-return-type]
void main () {
^
main.c:10:1: note: change return type to 'int'
void main () {
^~~~
int
main.c:14:52: error: implicit declaration of function 'sum' is invalid in C99
      [-Werror,-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
 printf("The sum of the first n integers is %d\n", sum(n));
                                                   ^
main.c:15:56: error: implicit declaration of function 'product' is invalid in C99
      [-Werror,-Wimplicit-function-declaration]

                                                       ^
1 warning and 2 errors generated.
```

We can get around this, by telling main about the functions by adding
```C
int sum(int n);
int product (int n);
```
to the `main.c`

```
nano main.c
```



```
gcc -Wall -g -c main.c
```

```
main.c:13:1: warning: return type of 'main' is not 'int' [-Wmain-return-type]
void main () {
^
main.c:13:1: note: change return type to 'int'
void main () {
^~~~
int
1 warning generated.
```

and then the helper code
```
gcc -Wall -g -c help.c
```



```
ls
```

```
hello		hello.dSYM	help.o		main.o
hello.c		help.c		main.c
```

````{tip}
One reason we split code is to make it readable, but another reason is what we just did.  We can compile each file separately, when your code is large and compiling takes a long time, splitting it will mean you only have to recompile the file(s) you have recently changed and relink, instead of recompiling everything.
````

and finally we link them.
```
gcc -o demo main.o help.o -lm
```


```
demo		hello.c		help.c		main.c
hello		hello.dSYM	help.o		main.o
```


```
./demo
```

```

## What does the `-o` option do?

we can remove it to see

```
gcc main.o help.o -lm
ls
```

in this case it makes up a name for  the executable
```
a.out		hello		hello.dSYM	help.o		main.o
demo		hello.c		help.c		main.c
```


```
ls -ls
```

```
total 352

```


```
./a.out
```

```
Please enter a small positive integer: 9
The sum of the first n integers is 45
The product of the first n integers is 362880
```
so it still works without specifying a name for the executable, but it's a lot neater to give it a meaningful name.

## Is the exectuable file binary?

Yes.  We'll discuss this more carefully next class.  It is binary, but the terminal app splits the binary every 8 bits and converts it to a character. Since that's now how the file was written, we get random looking characters.

cat demo

## Questions After Class


### Is there a benefit to linking object files like we did today rather than just compiling a larger file with all of the functions declared and defined?

Linking *has* to happen when you use libraries, we did this process to illustrate what happens.  Also it's much easier to read a larger file and can cut compilation time while you are working if you only have to recompile the small section you have edited recently.

### is C the closest low level program that's common now since no one uses assembly?

### What step of the compilation process is different from OS to OS?

A lot of the differences are actually at the hardware level, even within an OS, but the object code and executales are system-or system type specific.  

### what can you build with assembly language?

Anything!

### Where can I read documentation on parameters and meanings?

[gcc man](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/gcc.1.html)

### Are the weird symbols from the machine code mean anything to us? or is the computer trying to make sense of something with alphabetical significance?

This is machine code, it is binary that is designed for your hardware to interpret as instructions.

When we display it to the terminal, your computer tries to interpret that binary as text, so it ends up as weird characters mostly.

### I thought the final step was to convert code into binary? Is that something that we can't look at?

The object code and the exetuable are both binary

### Just confirming? To get an executable a compiler basically takes in the high level code to assembly which is then outputted to object code that is then linked doing "gcc -o <file> -lm" to create it?

Yes!!

### One thing I'm curious about is if it's possible to distinguish between compile errors and linking errors at the very least, more on if anything can be done about them when they pop up.

Delete the `main` and `help` object files and remove the declarations from the `main.c`.  Then try `gcc -Wall -g  main.c`.  You'll get a linker error, why?
