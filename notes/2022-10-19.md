# Bash Scripts


We'll start today in the top level folder for class

```
ls
```

```
2022-09-19			github-inclass-brownsarahm
courseutils			kwl-brownsarahm
fall2022			test
```

## Bash has programming constructs

We can create variables

```
NAME="Sarah"
```

and use them with a `$`

```
echo $NAME
```

```
Sarah
```

If we forget it, it treats it as a literal

```
echo NAME
```

```
NAME
```


We can also make loops

```
for name in "sarah" "mark" "linda" "david"
do
echo $name
done
ls
```

To run a command and make it a variable we can use `$(command)`.
For example:

```
for file in $(ls); do echo $file; done
```

```

courseutils
fall2022
github-inclass-brownsarahm
kwl-brownsarahm
test
```

## Searching files

`grep` searches files


This searches all of the files in the `test/` repo for "version"
```
grep "version" test/*
```

```
test/test.txt:version 1
test/test.txt:version 2
```
It finds two occurrences, prints the line, and tells us where it found each one


To have something to search we'll clone the course website

```
git clone https://github.com/introcompsys/fall2022.git
```


```
2022-09-19			github-inclass-brownsarahm
courseutils			kwl-brownsarahm
fall2022			test
```



I set it up in the `_review/`, `_prepare`, and `_practice` folders so that there is the syntax to denote the files that need to be created:

````
```{index} file.md
```
````


To find them all this way, we can `grep` for "index"

```
grep "index" fall2022/_review/*
```

```
fall2022/_review/2022-09-19.md:```{index} terminal
fall2022/_review/2022-09-21.md:```{index} branches.md
fall2022/_review/2022-09-26.md:```{index} abstraction.md
fall2022/_review/2022-09-28.md:```{index} gitlog.txt
fall2022/_review/2022-10-03.md:```{index} gitstory.md
fall2022/_review/2022-10-05.md:```{index} gitplumbingreview.md
fall2022/_review/2022-10-12.md:```{index} numbers.md
fall2022/_review/2022-10-12.md:```{index} hexpeak.md
fall2022/_review/2022-10-17.md:```{index} test_repo_map.md
```

We can use `awk` to pull out a subset of these results.  Remember a pipe `|` takes the stdout of one command and sends it to the in of the next.

```
grep "index" fall2022/_review/* | awk '{print $2}'
```

```
terminal
branches.md
abstraction.md
gitlog.txt
gitstory.md
gitplumbingreview.md
numbers.md
hexpeak.md
test_repo_map.md
```
Now we have just the files as a list.

Try `awk '{print $1}'` instead to understand `awk` better


## Check if a file exists

We can see if a file exists with `test`

```
test -f kwl-brownsarahm/branches.md
```

but it doesn't return the value, so we combine it with `if`

```
if test -f kwl-brownsarahm/branches.md
> then
> echo "exists"
> fi
exists
```

Note that `if` is ended with `fi`

## Checking if the your KWL has all the files it needs

We'll save this longer one in a script file

```
nano checker.sh
```

Then we can enter the following content:

```
for file in $(grep "index" fall2022/_review/* |awk '{print $2}')
do
if ! test -f kwl-brownsarahm/$file; then
echo $file
fi
done
```

For reference, we can look at what files are there
```
ls kwl-brownsarahm/
```

```
README.md	branches.md	check.sh	terminal
```

And then use the checker to denote the missing ones
```
bash checker.sh
```

```
abstraction.md
gitlog.txt
gitstory.md
gitplumbingreview.md
numbers.md
hexpeak.md
test_repo_map.md
```


## Review today's class

```{include} ../_review/2022-10-19.md
```



## Prepare for Next Class
````{margin}
```{important}
Prepare for class tasks are not always based on things that we have already done.  Sometimes they are to have you start thinking about the topic that we are *about* to cover. Getting whatever you know about the topic fresh in your mind in advance of class will help what we do in class stick for you when we start.
```

```{include} ../_prepare/2022-10-19.md

## Questions after Class

### Can I add another language like C to git bash?

Bash is a shell scripting language.  A shell is an interface to your computer's operating system. A terminal is how we access it. We will see that we can use a terminal to call a c compiler.


### Does git rely on scripts to do low-level commands for higher ones?

git is written mostly in `C` but there are some shell scripts [in its source code](https://github.com/git/git)

### How could I make the checker check a branch on my repo that isn't currently the selected branch?

The easiest way is to switch branches and check again.  You might be able to traverse the git repo, but that is not straight forward.

### what is one thing I should try and automate with bash

For now see the More practice
