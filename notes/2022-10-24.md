# How can I automate things on GitHub


We can use bash scripts on GitHub as GitHub Actions.


## Let's recall the course utils


We can test it on the [URI JupyterHub](https://jupyter.uri.edu/)

To log in,  Look in your e-mail for an e-mail about `jupyterhub access`

**this is not secure or backed up**

```{warning}
do not use the Jupyter hub server for any sensitive work (it is not secure) or as the only place for any work (it is not backed up; if something goes poorly data could be lost)
```

We can start with the courseutils

```
git clone https://github.com/introcompsys/courseutils.git
```

```
Cloning into 'courseutils'...

remote: Counting objects: 100% (79/79), done.

remote: Total 79 (delta 39), reused 59 (delta 25), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (79/79), done.
```

And then cd and install it
```
cd courseutils/
pip install .
```

```

```
sysgetassignment --date 2022-10-19
```

By default it gets the prepare for class tasks for that date
````
- [ ] On Windows, install Putty ( we will use this Monday)
2. Get ready for class by creating `networking.md` in your KWL repo with notes about what you know about networking
3. Add an issue on your KWL repo titled "Self Reflection 10/24" (there will be time on Monday for this, but giving you warning so you have time to think about it). Tag @brownsarahm on this issue.
```{index} networking.md
```
```
- [ ] Are you where you want to be in this course?
- [ ] Have you been getting feedback on your work?
- [ ] If not, what could help you get back on track?
- [ ] What if any concepts are you most struggling with?
```
````


```
sysgetassignment --date 2022-10-19 --type practice
```

````
- [ ] Make your script form class a nested loop to check for all 3 types of files
- [ ] Make a script that gets the updates to the course site and creates a single `todo-YYYY-MM-DD.md` file that has the review, prepare, and practice tasks in it  for each date that does not already exist in a `todo/` folder outside of your KWL repo. Save the script as `gathertasks.sh`


```{index} checker.sh
```
```{index} gathertasks.sh
```

## Writing GitHub Action as bash script practice

GitHub Actions allow us to run code on GitHub's servers.  

As a first script, we can put the following [YAML](https://yaml.org/) content in.

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch

jobs:
  check-contents:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    # Install dependencies
    - name: Set up Python 3.8
      uses: actions/setup-python@v1
      with:
        python-version: 3.8

    - name: Install checker
      run: |
        pip install git+https://github.com/introcompsys/courseutils@main


    - name: check
      run: |
        pwd
```

The first two keys are configuration information.
- `on` tells GitHub what triggers this action
- `jobs` lists the things it has to do

In this case, we will trigger by the a button and our job is named `check-contents`

The next two things are settings for this job; first that it runs on ubuntu and then a list of steps to complete.

For each step (beginning with a `-`) we can give it a name (optional) and then either `uses` to choose something from the [GitHub Action Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions) or `run` to enter bash commands.  

The first two steps are from the marketplace: checkout the repo and setup python.  

Then we install the courseutils directly via git and the last step prints the working directory.


To use the action, add it as a file to `.github/workflows/get_assignment.yml`

Then run it and check the output

<iframe src="https://scribehow.com/embed/Github_Workflow__ngUTbsWIRtSMhuLy2V7kaQ" width="640" height="640" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"></iframe>



Then we can modify the script by replacing the `pwd` with the steps we actually need.


```
- name: check
  run: |
    sysgetassignment --date 2022-10-19 | gh issue create --title "review" --body-file -
  env:
    GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

This gets the todos from last week and creates an issue.

The `env` allows the GitHub action bot to actually edit the repo (make an issue)
