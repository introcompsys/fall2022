2. For the core "Porcelain" git commands we have used (add, commit, push), make a table of which git plumbing commands (of those we have seen) they use in `gitplumbingreview.md` in your KWL repo. it might be multiple Porcelain for each plumbing.
3. Contribute to your group repo and review a classmate's contribution
