1. Update your KWL Chart learned column with what you've learned
2. Make a [contribution](groupcontrib) to your group repo and do a peer review of a team member's PR.
3. Use the gh cli, grep, and bash to create `group_contributions.md` to your KWL repo with a list of all of your PRs. Append your history from creating this to the bottom of the file after `## Commands`
4. Move your checker script into your kwl repo and update the paths so that it still works

```{index}  group_contributions.md
```

```{index}  checker.sh
```
